      <description>Welcome to my website! My name is Derzsi DÃ¡niel. I&amp;rsquo;m a university student currently enrolled at Sapientia University, studying Computer Science. I enjoy playing games and talking with my friends. My friends are definitely the most value in my life right now.
As a professional, I am currently studying reverse engineering. I have many years of experience working with Python, C++ and Java, creating various games, applications and servers. System administration is my favorite activity.</description>
